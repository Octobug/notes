## Introduction

Many English words are formed by taking basic words and adding combinations of
prefixes and suffixes to them. A basic word to which **affixes** (**prefixes**
and **suffixes**) are added is called a **root word** because it forms the
basis of a new word. The root word is also a word in its own right. For
example, the word `lovely` consists of the word `love` and the suffix `-ly`.

In contrast, a **root** is the basis of a new word, but it does not typically
form a stand-alone word on its own. For example, the word `reject` is made up
of the prefix `re-` and the Latin root `ject`, which is not a stand-alone word.

## Affixes

One method of understanding the meanings of new words is to analyze the
different parts of the word and the meanings of those parts. Many new words are
formed by adding an **affix** to the beginning or end of a Latin or Greek root
or root word. When affixes are added to the beginning of roots or root words,
they are called **prefixes** For example, the most common prefix is `un-`,
which meant *not* or *opposite of*. If you add `un-` to the word `happy`, the
new word becomes `unhappy`, which means *not happy*. When affixes are added to
the end of roots or root words, they are called **suffixes**. The most common
suffixes are `-s` and `-es`, which mean more than one (or the plural) of the
word. Adding `-es` to `wish`, changes the meaning o the word to *more than one
wish*.
