定语从句的两个重要概念: **先行词**和**关系词**。

## 3.1 定语从句概述

### 3.1.1 形容词作定语与从句作定语比较

- `例 1`: I don't like **lazy** *people*.
  - 形容词作定语
  - 形容词作定语要置于被修饰名词的前面
- `例 2`: I don't like *people* **who never keep their word**.
  - 完整的句子作定语
  - 从句修饰名词要置于被修饰名词的后面

一个有完整主谓结构的句子，用作定语功能修饰另一个句子 (主句) 中的某个成分，
这个句子称为定语从句。

### 3.1.2 定语从句的两个重要概念: 先行词和关系词

#### 一、先行词

被定语从句修饰的对象称为**先行词**。

#### 二、关系词

重复指代先行词、起连接主句和从句的作用，
并且**在定语从句中充当一定成分**的连接词称为**关系词**。
关系词有两个作用:

1. **代词的作用**: 重复指代先行词并且在定语从句充当一定成分。
2. **连接作用**: 连接主句和从句。

### 思维训练 3.1

**请找出下列短文中的定语从句，并指明先行词和关系词。**

***Passage 3***:

*Beauty means this to one and that to the other. And yet when anyone of us has
seen that which to him is beautiful he has known an emotion which is in every
case the same in kind.*

**答案**:

第二句话:

- 两个定语从句:
  1. And yet when anyone of us has seen that **which to him is beautiful**
     - 定语从句 which to him is beautiful 修饰先行词 that，关系词是 which
     - 先行词 that 是代词，指代前面所说的 beauty，作为句子的宾语
     - him 指代 anyone of us
  2. he has known an emotion **which is in every case the same in kind**.
     - 定语从句 which is in every case the same in kind 修饰先行词 emotion，关系词是
       which
     - he 和 him 一样指代 anyone of us
- 字面直译: 然而，当我们任何一个人见到对他来说是美的事物时，
他就知道了一种在任何情况下都相通的情感。

完整翻译: 审美标准，因人而异。但一旦美在眼前出现，我们对美的感受却并无二致。

## 3.2 关系词在定语从句中充当的成分

### 3.2.1 关系词用作从句的主语

`例 1`: **The woman** is a famous dancer and **she** lives next door. (简单句)

这两个简单句有一个"重复元素"，she 指代 the woman，即两个句子通过这个共同的元素建立联系。
在定语从句中，指代"人"的关系词要用 who。用 she lives next door 作定语修饰 the woman，
可改写为:

The woman is a famous dancer who lives next door.

这里关系词 who 取代了**代词** she 也取代了**连词** and，即 who
既具有代词的作用也起着连词的作用。另外，定语从句一般要紧跟在它所修饰的名词后面。
因此上一句可改写为:

The woman who lives next door is a famous dancer.

`例 2`:

- I like guys **and they** have a good sense of humor.
- I like guys **who** have a good sense of humor.

**句子转换总结**:

1. 用关系代词 who 代替人称代词后，定语从句里就不能再保留这些代词了。
2. 定语从句可以修饰主句当中的任何一个名词。
   但是我们关注的往往是**关系词在定语从句中所充当的成分**，
   而不关心定语从句是修饰主句的哪个名词。
3. 定语从句的主谓一致: **定语从句的谓语动词形式是由关系词所指代的先行词来决定的**，
   而不是取决于关系词本身。

- `例 6`: The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.
  - those: those 是代词，和名词一样可以被定语从句修饰。
- `例 7`: A rich person is not one who has the most, but is one who needs the
  least.
  - one: 这里 one 作为代词，和名词一样可以被定语从句修饰。

### 3.2.2 关系词用作从句动词的宾语

关系词作为从句动词的宾语可以区分为从句**动词的并与**和从句**介词的宾语**。

`例 1`:

- I'd really like to find **a friend** and I can trust **him** completely.
- 用关系词 who 代替 him，并去掉 and: I'd really like to find **a friend** ... I can
  trust **who** completely.
- 关系词 who 要置于从句开头: I'd really like to find a friend **who** I can trust
  ... completely.
- I'd really like to find a friend who I can trust completely.

### 3.2.3 关系词用作从句中介词的宾语

- `例 1`:
  - I'm talking about friends and you can share almost everything with **them**.
  - I'm talking about friends **who** you can share almost everything **with**.
  - I'm talking about friends **with whom** you can share almost everything.
- `例 2`: I hope I never have a boss who I can't talk to about my problems.
- `例 3`: I like the people who I work with.

`补充例句`: **In other words, anyone can improve the speed with which he gets
what he wants from his reading**.

- 主句结构: anyone can improve the speed.
- 修饰 the speed 的定语从句: with which he gets what he wants from his reading.
- `the speed` with which he gets `what he wants` from his reading.
  
  可还原成:

  he gets `what he wants (宾语从句)` from his reading with `the speed`.

- 译: 换句话说，任何人都可以提高**足以让他从阅读中得到他想要的东西**的速度。

### 3.2.4 作宾语的关系词可以省去

关系词在定语从句中主要可以充当两种成分: **主语**或**宾语 (动词的宾语或介词的宾语)**。
英语里有这样的习惯: **作宾语的关系词可以省去**，不论关系词是作动词的宾语还是作介词的宾语。
上面的例句可改写成:

- I'd really to find a friend I can trust completely.
- I'm talking about friends you can share almost everything with.
- I hope I never have a boss I can't talk to about my problems.

## 3.3 关系代词与先行词的搭配关系

关系词可以分为两大类:

1. **关系代词**: 主要起着代词的作用，在定语从句里充当主语, 宾语或定语 (whose)。
   1. who/whom: 先行词只能是指"人"
   2. which: 先行词只能是指"物"
   3. that/whose: 先行词可以指"人"或"物"
2. **关系副词**: 主要起着副词的作用，在定语从句里充当状语。
   1. when
   2. where
   3. why

### 3.3.1 先行词指“人”，用关系代词 who 或 whom

#### 一、先行词指“人”才能用 who 或 whom

`例 1`: I'm talking about friends who you can share almost everything with.

#### 二、who 和 whom 的区别

1. **who 的前面不能与介词搭配使用**

    因为 who 是**主格**形式，所以在介词的后面不能使用 who。

    - `例 2`: I'm talking about friends who you can share almost everything
      with.
      - ❌ I'm talking about friends with who you can share almost everything.
      - ✅ I'm talking about friends with whom you can share almost everything.

    主格形式的 who 除了作定语从句的主语外，还可以充当定语从句的宾语或表语。

2. **whom 在定语从句中不能作主语，但可作宾语或表语**

    `例 3`: A rich person is not one who has the most, but is one who needs
    the least.

    这里 who 作从句主语，所以不能用 whom。

总之，who 可以作主语，**也可以替代 whom 作宾语或表语**，但不能用在介词后面。而因为 who
是宾格形式，所以不能作主语。

### 3.3.2 表示人或物的所有关系，用 whose

whose 表示所有关系，其作用就如同物主代词 my, your, her, his, their 和 our，whose
的后面要接名词。whose 可指人也可指物。
"whose + 名词"在从句中可作**主语**、**动词的宾语**或**介词的宾语**。

- `例 1`:
  - I know a friend. **His** brother is a pop singer.
  - I know a frined **whose** brother is a pop singer.
- `例 2`:
  - These children sit in a schoolroom. **Its** windows are all broken.
  - These children sit in a schoolroom **whose** windows are all broken.
- `例 3`: When I looked through the window, I saw a girl whose beauty took my
  breath away.
- `例 4`: It was a meeting whose importance I did not realize at the time.
- `例 5`: Atlas (in Greek mythology) was a kneeling man on whose shoulder the
  world rested.
  - whose shoulder 作从句中 rested on 的宾语，这里 on 被提前了。

### 3.3.3 先行词指“物”，用关系代词 which

关系词 which 的造句结构完全类似于 who，比如 which 可以作从句的**主语**或**宾语**，
只不过 which 的先行词是"物"。

`例 1`:

- We are studying sentences. **They** contain adjective clauses.
- We are studying sentences **which** contain adjective clauses.

这里先行词是 sentences，表示"物"，因此不能用 who。

⚠️ 关系词 which 所指代的先行词比较复杂， 它除了可以指单个的名词外，还可以指代短语甚至是从句。

#### 一、先行词是单个的名词

- `例 2`: Anger is a **wind** which blows out the lamp of the mind.
- `例 3`: Perhaps it is human to appreciate little **that** which we have and to
  long for **that** which we have not.
  - 先行词是 that，即 which 指单个的名词。

#### 二、先行词是一个短语

which 可以指代一个短语。

`例 4`: He likes **climbing mountains**, which is a good exercise.

先行词是主句中的一个动名词短语 climbing mountains。

#### 三、先行词是一个句子

which 可以指代前面的整个句子。

- `例 5`:
  - Tom was late. **That** surprised me.
  - Tom was late, **which** surprised me.
    - 全局 "Tom was late." 作 which 的先行词。
- `例 6`: He tore up my photo, which upset me.
- `例 7`: I became a single mother overnight, which is nothing like becoming
  famous overnight.

### 3.3.4 that 可以指代“人”，也可以指代“物”

关系代词 that 的意义和用法主要有以下三点:

1. that 既可指"人"也可指"物"，指"物"时可以替换 which，指"人"时可以替换 who；
2. that 不用在**非限制性定语从句**中；
3. that 不能于介词的后面(和 who 一样)。

`例 1`: Too many people spend money **which** they haven't earned, to buy things
**which** they don't want, to impress people **who** they don't like.

可用 that 改为: Too many people spend money **that** they haven't earned, to buy
things **that** they don't want, to impress people **that** they don't like.

另外，从句中作宾语的关系词可以省去，因此这里 that 也都可以省去。

既然 **that** 可以指物也可以指人，那么就会涉及与 **which** 和 **who** 在用法上的区别。
以下这些情况最好使用 that:

#### 3.3.4.1 先行词中同时出现"人"和"物"时，用 that

- `例 2`: The writer and his novels that the article deals with are quite
  familiar to us.
  - 这里先行词是 the writer and his novels
  - 译: 这篇文章里所说的这个作家以及他的小说，我们都比较熟悉。

#### 3.3.4.2 先行词为指"物"的 all, little, few, much, none 和 the first 时，用 that

- `例 3`: **All** that glitters is not gold.
  - 这里的先行词是 all，所以用 that 来引导定语从句。另外这里的否定是**半否定**:
    "all ... not ..." 应翻译成"并非都是"，而不是**全否定**的"所有都不"。
  - 译: 闪光的并非都是金子。
- `例 4`: The book contains **little** that is useful.
  - 这里的先行词是表示否定意义的代词 little，所以用 that 来引导定语从句。
- `例 5`: There is not **much** that can be done.
  - 这里的先行词是代词 much，所以用 that 来引导定语从句。

#### 3.3.4.3 先行词是不定代词 something, anything, nothing 和 everything 时，一般用 that

- `例 7`: I would much rather receive **something** that made me laugh, made me
  reminisce, or fit my personality than **something** that cost a lot but that
  I will just throw in my closet and forget about.

#### 3.3.4.4 先行词被这几类特殊词修饰时，用 that

- any, only, all, every, no, some, much, few, little
  - `例 8`: Tell us **all** things that you know.
  - `例 9`: There is **no** difficult that they can't overcome.
  - `例 10`: The **only** thing that we should do is find our way home.
- 序数词，形容词最高级
- the only, the one, the very, the right 和 the last
  - `例 11`: The **very** problem that I want to solve is like this.
  - `例 12`: He is the **only** man that can speak four foreign languages in
    our company.

#### 3.3.4.5 that 不用在非限制性定语从句中

不用 that 引导非限制性定语从句。比如:

- `例 13`: I became a single mother overnight, which is nothing like becoming
  famous overnight.
  - ❌ I became a single mother overnight, **that** is nothing like becoming
    famous overnight.

#### 3.3.4.6 不能用于介词后面

不能在 that 前面使用介词。比如:

- `例 14`
  - The world in which we live is made up of matter.
  - The world which we live in is made up of matter.
  - The world that we live in is made up of matter.
  - ❌ The world **in that** we live is made up of matter.

### 补充：3.3.5 先行词与关系词被分隔

- `例 1`：Today stepladders carry **labels** several inches long **that** warn,
  among other things, that you might -- surprise! -- fall off.
- `例 2`：There exists no **language or dialect** in the world **that** cannot
  convey complex ideas.

### 补充：3.3.6 关系代词 as

as 主要引导**非限制性**定语从句，它的“先行词”一般是一整句话。

- `例 1`：As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of
  cultural signals, assumptions, and conventions underlies all social
  interrelationships.
  - As 指代 "in America a complex set of cultural signals, assumptions, and
    conventions underlies all social interrelationships"，在从句中作主语。
- `例 2`：This description even fits the majority of eminent scholars. "Being
  learned in some branch of human knowledge is one thing, living in public and
  illustrious thoughts," as Emerson would say, "is something else."
  - as 指代 "Being learned in some branch of human knowledge is one thing,
    living in public and illustrious thoughts is something else."，
    在从句中作宾语。
- `例 3`：Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry -- William
  Shakespeare -- but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile
  branches.
  - as 指代 "Stratford-on-Avon has only one industry"，在从句中作宾语。
- `例 4`：I have discovered as perhaps Kelsey will (discover) after her
  much-publicized resignation from the editorship of *She* after a build up of
  stress, that abandoning the doctrine of "juggling your life," and making the
  alternative move into "downshifting" brings with it far greater rewards than
  financial success and social status.
  - as 在从句中作宾语。

## 3.4 关系副词的用法

### 3.4.1 when 的用法

#### 一、先行词指时间

when 可以引导**限制性**和**非限制性**定语从句，其先行词必须是表示时间的名词，如 day, year
或 time 等。

- `例 1`: I'll never forget the day when I met you.
- `例 2`: The day when we stop learning is the day when we die.
- `例 3`: My favorite season is spring, when the earth seems born again.
  - 非限制性定语从句
- `例 4`: We will put off the outing until next week, when we won't be so busy.
  - 非限制性定语从句
- `例 5`: March 10, 1876 was the day when the first complete sentence was sent
  over a telephone.
- `例 6`: The day may soon come when we don't bother to go to office but just
  work **at home**.

#### 二、关系副词 when 在从句中作时间状语

若定语从句不是缺少状语，而是**缺少主语或宾语，那么即使先行词是表示时间的名词，也不能用 when
而要用 which 或 that 来引导定语从句**。因为用 when 来引导定语从句的前提条件是: when
必须在其引导的定语从句中作**时间状语**。

- `例 7`:
  - I'll never forget the time **which** I spent on campus.
    - 关系词在从句中充当**宾语**
  - I'll never forget the day **when** we first met in the park.
    - 关系词在从句中充当**状语**
- `例 8`: The day, which began brightly, ended with a violent storm.
  - 关系词在非限制性从句中充当**主语**

### 3.4.2 where 的用法

#### 一、where 的先行词指地点

where 可以引导**限制性**和**非限制性**定语从句，其先行词一般是表示地点的名词，如 place 和
house 等。

- `例 1`:
  - A: Since you work in the theater, can't you get me a free ticket now and
    then?
  - B: Certainly if you bring me a few notes now and then from the bank where
    you work!
- `例 2`: Do you know any place where I can buy Mr. Zhang's grammar book?
- `例 3`: This is the town where I spent my childhood.

#### 二、关系副词 where 在从句中作地点状语

与 where 类似，并非先行词是表示地点的名词时，都得由 where 来引导定语从句，
这得看关系词在句中充当的成分。
**若定语从句缺主语或宾语，则要用 which 或 that 引导定语从句**。

- `例 4`:
  - This is the town where I spent my childhood.
    - 关系词在从句中作状语
  - This is the town which I told you about before.
    - 关系词在从句中作宾语
- `例 5`:
  - The library where students often study was on fire last night.
    - 关系词在从句中作状语
  - The library, which was built in the 1930's, needs to be renovated.
    - 关系词在从句中作主语
- `例 6`: I've never been to Beijing, but it's the place ____.
  - A. where I'd like to visit
  - B. in which I'd like to visit
  - C. I most want to visit
  - D. that I want to visit it most
  - 答案: C. (that/which) I most want to visit

### 3.4.3 why 的用法

why 用来表示原因，只引导**限制性**定语从句，先行词是 reason 等表示原因的名词。

This is the reason why I didn't come here.

### 思维训练 3.4

**一、请将下列每一组中的两个简单句合并为一个定语从句，用第二个句子作定语。**

*2. He arrived in Shanghai that day. On the same day I left.*

答案: He arrived in Shanghai on the day when I left.

*5. The city was beautiful. We spent our vacationn there.*

答案: The city where we spent our vacation was beautiful.

*8. This is the house. They put their tools in it.*

答案: This is the house where they put their tools.

## 3.5 限制性与非限制性定语从句

二者在形式上的区别:

- 在**限制性**定语从句中，先行词和关系词之间不用逗号隔开；
- 在**非限制性**定语从句中，先行词和关系词之间需要逗号隔开。

### 3.5.1 限制性定语从句——不用逗号隔开

**限制性**定语从句是用来对一个名词提供**必要**的信息 (a defining relative clause
defines or gives essential information about a noun)，
以说明定语从句所修饰的先行词的**身份或性质**，或用来限制先行词**所指的范围**。
若去掉限制性定语从句，则主句部分含义不明确，或意义不完整，所以不能用逗号来分隔先行词和定语从句。

比如 "I don't like people." 这句话意思不明确，people 需要加上限定性的修饰语。

- `例 1`: I don't like people *who are never on time*.
- `例 2`: I don't like people *who never keep their word*.
- `例 3`: There are two factors *which determine an individual's intelligence*.
- `例 4`: He is a man *who is of value to the people*.

### 3.5.2 非限制性定语从句——用逗号隔开

非限制性定语从句用来提供**附加的而非必要**的信息，只是对先行词做进一步的解释、补充或说明
(a non-defining relative clause gives optional information about a noun)。
若是去掉此定语从句，整个主句的意义一样很明确，不会引起误解和歧义。
一般来讲，先行词为**专有名词**和**类指名词**的句子，其后都宜用非限制性定语从句。

#### 一、专有名词

定语从句修饰一个专有名词，一般要用逗号分隔先行词与定语从句，也就是使用非限制性定语从句。
这是因为专有名词本身的意思已经很完整，不需要限制，用定语从句只是对它进行补充说明。

- `例 1`: My mother, who is 50 this year, lives with me now.
  - mother 是专有名词，这里 my mother 意义明确，who is 50 this year
    只能作为非限制性定语从句来修饰它。如果说成
    "My mother who is 50 this year lives with me now."，
    则言外之意是"我有好几个母亲，目前和我住在一起的是今年 50 岁的那位母亲。"
- `例 4`: Beijing, which is the capital of China, has developed into an
  international city.
- `例 5`: Einstein, who was a great Jewish scientist, created the theory of
  relativity.
- `例 6`: Hawaii, which consists of eight principal islands, is a favorite
  vacation spot.

#### 二、类指名词

普通名词若是用来表示**类指**，即表示的是一类事物，而非具体的某一个事物，此时，
其后也宜用非限制性定语从句。

`例 7`:

- An elephant, which is the earth's largest land mammal, has few natural enemies
  other than human beings.
  - 这里 elephant 是类指或泛指，表示"大象"这类动物，而不是具体的某一头大象。
- One of the elephants which we saw at the zoo had only one tusk.
  - 这里的 elephant 是具体指代某一头大象。

### 3.5.3 用或不用逗号，句意有差别

还有一类句子，用限制性或非限制性定语从句都可以，但强调的意义不一样。

- `例 1`:
  - He has a daughter who works in a hospital.
    - 他有一个在医院工作的女儿。(有多个女儿)
  - He has a daughter, who works in a hospital.
    - 他有个女儿，是在医院工作的。
- `例 2`:
  - The food which wasn't in the fridge all went off.
    - 定语从句是用于限定 food 的范围
    - 没有放在冰箱里的那些食物坏了。(部分食物坏了)
  - The food, which wasn't in the fridge, all went off.
    - 定语从句是用于补充说明 food 坏的原因
    - 食物都坏了，因为没有放在冰箱里。
- `例 3`:
  - The cab drivers who knew about the traffic jam took another road.
    - 知道那里堵车的出租车司机换了另一条路。
  - The cab drivers, who knew about the traffic jam, took another road.
    - 出租车司机知道那里堵车了，他们都换了另一条路。

### 3.5.4 非限制性定语从句的翻译

- `例 1`: The food, which wasn't in the fridge, all went off.
  - 食物都坏了，因为没有放在冰箱里。(译成**原因状语**从句)

  especially wished to talk.

    (译成**原因状语**从句)

### 思维训练 3.5

**二、请分析下面句中所含定语从句分别属于本节所述 3 种情形中的哪一种，必要时请添加逗号。**

*13. The teacher who comes from Canada teaches us English.*

答案: the teacher 为特指，所以应该添加逗号，改为非限制性定从句:

The teacher, who comes from Canada, teaches us English.

*15. I saw him stand under the apple tree which was behind the house.*

答案: 限制性或非限制性均可。

- 限制性定语从句: 表明屋子周围有多棵树。
- I saw him stand under the apple tree, which was behind the house.
  - 非限制性定语从句: 表明屋子周围只有一棵树，the apple tree 为特指。

*19. One of the elephants which we saw at the zoo had only one tusk.*

答案: 保留限制性定语从句。One of the elephants had only one tusk.
去掉定语从句后无法确定是哪些大象。

*20. The rice which we had for dinner last night was very good.*

答案: 保留限制性定语从句。The rice was very good. 去掉定语从句后无法确定是哪些米饭。

*22. Jane was delighted when she opened the present which was from her
ex-boyfriend.*

答案: 限制性或非限制性均可。

- 限制性定语从句: 表明 Jane 收到了多份礼物。
- Jane was delighted when she opened the present, which was from her
  ex-boyfriend.
  - 非限制性定语从句，表明 Jane 只收到一份礼物。

## 3.6 定语从句与同位语从句的区分

### 3.6.1 从结构上区分: that 是否作成分

- that 在**定语从句**中要充当成分，比如作从句的主语或宾语: "名词 + that + 不完整的句子"
- that 在**同位语从句**中不充当任何成分，仅起连词的作用: "名词 + that + 完整的陈述句"
- `例 1`:
  - The rumor that he spread everywhere turned out to be untrue.
  - The rumor that Tom was a thief turned out to be untrue.
- `例 2`:
  - The fact that we talked about is very important.
  - The fact that he succeeded in the experiment pleased everybody.

### 3.6.2 从意义上区分: that 引导的从句的意义不同

- 定语从句相当于形容词，对先行词起修饰、描述和限制的作用
- 同位语从句相当于一个名词，是对先行词内容的具体表述，二者是同位关系

`例 1`:

- The news that you heard is not true.
  - "that you heard" 并不是表示 news 的内容，只是在限制 news 所指的范围。
- The news that Lincoln was murdered at a theater is true.
  - that Lincoln was murdered at a theater 表示 news 的具体内容，在意义上与 news
    构成同位关系。
