定语从句的两个重要概念: **先行词**和**关系词**。

## 3.1 定语从句概述

### 3.1.1 形容词作定语与从句作定语比较

- `例 1`: I don't like **lazy** *people*.
  - 形容词作定语
  - 形容词作定语要置于被修饰名词的前面
- `例 2`: I don't like *people* **who never keep their word**.
  - 完整的句子作定语
  - 从句修饰名词要置于被修饰名词的后面

一个有完整主谓结构的句子，用作定语功能修饰另一个句子 (主句) 中的某个成分，
这个句子称为定语从句。

### 3.1.2 定语从句的两个重要概念: 先行词和关系词

#### 一、先行词

被定语从句修饰的对象称为**先行词**。

#### 二、关系词

重复指代先行词、起连接主句和从句的作用，
并且**在定语从句中充当一定成分**的连接词称为**关系词**。
关系词有两个作用:

1. **代词的作用**: 重复指代先行词并且在定语从句充当一定成分。
2. **连接作用**: 连接主句和从句。

### 思维训练 3.1

**请找出下列短文中的定语从句，并指明先行词和关系词。**

***Passage 3***:

*Beauty means this to one and that to the other. And yet when anyone of us has
seen that which to him is beautiful he has known an emotion which is in every
case the same in kind.*

**答案**:

第二句话:

- 两个定语从句:
  1. And yet when anyone of us has seen that **which to him is beautiful**
     - 定语从句 which to him is beautiful 修饰先行词 that，关系词是 which
     - 先行词 that 是代词，指代前面所说的 beauty，作为句子的宾语
     - him 指代 anyone of us
  2. he has known an emotion **which is in every case the same in kind**.
     - 定语从句 which is in every case the same in kind 修饰先行词 emotion，关系词是
       which
     - he 和 him 一样指代 anyone of us
- 字面直译: 然而，当我们任何一个人见到对他来说是美的事物时，
他就知道了一种在任何情况下都相通的情感。

完整翻译: 审美标准，因人而异。但一旦美在眼前出现，我们对美的感受却并无二致。

## 3.2 关系词在定语从句中充当的成分

### 3.2.1 关系词用作从句的主语

`例 1`: **The woman** is a famous dancer and **she** lives next door. (简单句)

这两个简单句有一个"重复元素"，she 指代 the woman，即两个句子通过这个共同的元素建立联系。
在定语从句中，指代"人"的关系词要用 who。用 she lives next door 作定语修饰 the woman，
可改写为:

The woman is a famous dancer who lives next door.

这里关系词 who 取代了**代词** she 也取代了**连词** and，即 who
既具有代词的作用也起着连词的作用。另外，定语从句一般要紧跟在它所修饰的名词后面。
因此上一句可改写为:

The woman who lives next door is a famous dancer.

`例 2`:

- I like guys **and they** have a good sense of humor.
- I like guys **who** have a good sense of humor.

**句子转换总结**:

1. 用关系代词 who 代替人称代词后，定语从句里就不能再保留这些代词了。
2. 定语从句可以修饰主句当中的任何一个名词。
   但是我们关注的往往是**关系词在定语从句中所充当的成分**，
   而不关心定语从句是修饰主句的哪个名词。
3. 定语从句的主谓一致: **定语从句的谓语动词形式是由关系词所指代的先行词来决定的**，
   而不是取决于关系词本身。

- `例 6`: The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.
  - those: those 是代词，和名词一样可以被定语从句修饰。
- `例 7`: A rich person is not one who has the most, but is one who needs the
  least.
  - one: 这里 one 作为代词，和名词一样可以被定语从句修饰。

### 3.2.2 关系词用作从句动词的宾语

关系词作为从句动词的宾语可以区分为从句**动词的并与**和从句**介词的宾语**。

`例 1`:

- I'd really like to find **a friend** and I can trust **him** completely.
- 用关系词 who 代替 him，并去掉 and: I'd really like to find **a friend** ... I can
  trust **who** completely.
- 关系词 who 要置于从句开头: I'd really like to find a friend **who** I can trust
  ... completely.
- I'd really like to find a friend who I can trust completely.

### 3.2.3 关系词用作从句中介词的宾语

- `例 1`:
  - I'm talking about friends and you can share almost everything with **them**.
  - I'm talking about friends **who** you can share almost everything **with**.
- `例 2`: I hope I never have a boss who I can't talk to about my problems.
- `例 3`: I like the people who I work with.

### 3.2.4 作宾语的关系词可以省去

关系词在定语从句中主要可以充当两种成分: **主语**或**宾语 (动词的宾语或介词的宾语)**。
英语里有这样的习惯: **作宾语的关系词可以省去**，不论关系词是作动词的宾语还是作介词的宾语。
上面的例句可改写成:

- I'd really to find a friend I can trust completely.
- I'm talking about friends you can share almost everything with.
- I hope I never have a boss I can't talk to about my problems.

## 3.3 关系代词与先行词的搭配关系

关系词可以分为两大类:

1. **关系代词**: 主要起着代词的作用，在定语从句里充当主语, 宾语或定语 (whose)。
   1. who/whom: 先行词只能是指"人"
   2. which: 先行词只能是指"物"
   3. that/whose: 先行词可以指"人"或"物"
2. **关系副词**: 主要起着副词的作用，在定语从句里充当状语。
   1. when
   2. where
   3. why

### 3.3.1 先行词指“人”，用关系代词 who 或 whom

#### 一、先行词指“人”才能用 who 或 whom

`例 1`: I'm talking about friends who you can share almost everything with.

#### 二、who 和 whom 的区别

1. **who 的前面不能与介词搭配使用**

    因为 who 是**主格**形式，所以在介词的后面不能使用 who。

    - `例 2`: I'm talking about friends who you can share almost everything
      with.
      - ❌ I'm talking about friends with who you can share almost everything.
      - ✅ I'm talking about friends with whom you can share almost everything.

    主格形式的 who 除了作定语从句的主语外，还可以充当定语从句的宾语或表语。

2. **whom 在定语从句中不能作主语，但可作宾语或表语**

    `例 3`: A rich person is not one who has the most, but is one who needs
    the least.

    这里 who 作从句主语，所以不能用 whom。

总之，who 可以作主语，**也可以替代 whom 作宾语或表语**，但不能用在介词后面。而因为 who
是宾格形式，所以不能作主语。

### 3.3.2 表示人或物的所有关系，用 whose

whose 表示所有关系，其作用就如同物主代词 my, your, her, his, their 和 our，whose
的后面要接名词。whose 可指人也可指物。
"whose + 名词"在从句中可作**主语**、**动词的宾语**或**介词的宾语**。

- `例 1`:
  - I know a friend. **His** brother is a pop singer.
  - I know a frined **whose** brother is a pop singer.
- `例 2`:
  - These children sit in a schoolroom. **Its** windows are all broken.
  - These children sit in a schoolroom **whose** windows are all broken.
- `例 3`: When I looked through the window, I saw a girl whose beauty took my
  breath away.
- `例 4`: It was a meeting whose importance I did not realize at the time.
- `例 5`: Atlas (in Greek mythology) was a kneeling man on whose shoulder the
  world rested.
  - whose shoulder 作从句中 rested on 的宾语，这里 on 被提前了。

### 3.3.3 先行词指“物”，用关系代词 which

关系词 which 的造句结构完全类似于 who，比如 which 可以作从句的**主语**或**宾语**，
只不过 which 的先行词是"物"。

`例 1`:

- We are studying sentences. **They** contain adjective clauses.
- We are studying sentences **which** contain adjective clauses.

这里先行词是 sentences，表示"物"，因此不能用 who。

⚠️ 关系词 which 所指代的先行词比较复杂， 它除了可以指单个的名词外，还可以指代短语甚至是从句。

#### 一、先行词是单个的名词

- `例 2`: Anger is a **wind** which blows out the lamp of the mind.
- `例 3`: Perhaps it is human to appreciate little **that** which we have and to
  long for **that** which we have not.
  - 先行词是 that，即 which 指单个的名词。

#### 二、先行词是一个短语

which 可以指代一个短语。

`例 4`: He likes **climbing mountains**, which is a good exercise.

先行词是主句中的一个动名词短语 climbing mountains。

#### 三、先行词是一个句子

which 可以指代前面的整个句子。

- `例 5`:
  - Tom was late. **That** surprised me.
  - Tom was late, **which** surprised me.
    - 全局 "Tom was late." 作 which 的先行词。
- `例 6`: He tore up my photo, which upset me.
- `例 7`: I became a single mother overnight, which is nothing like becoming
  famous overnight.

### 3.3.4 that 可以指代“人”，也可以指代“物”

关系代词 that 的意义和用法主要有以下三点:

1. that 既可指"人"也可指"物"，指"物"时可以替换 which，指"人"时可以替换 who；
2. that 不用在**非限制性定语从句**中；
3. that 不能于介词的后面(和 who 一样)。

`例 1`: Too many people spend money **which** they haven't earned, to buy things
**which** they don't want, to impress people **who** they don't like.

可用 that 改为: Too many people spend money **that** they haven't earned, to buy
things **that** they don't want, to impress people **that** they don't like.

另外，从句中作宾语的关系词可以省去，因此这里 that 也都可以省去。

既然 **that** 可以指物也可以指人，那么就会涉及与 **which** 和 **who** 在用法上的区别。
以下这些情况最好使用 that:

1. **先行词中同时出现"人"和"物"时，用 that**

    `例 2`: The writer and his novels that the article deals with are quite
    familiar to us.

    - 这里先行词是 the writer and his novels
    - 译: 这篇文章里所说的这个作家以及他的小说，我们都比较熟悉。

2. **先行词为指"物"的 all, little, few, much, none 和 the first 时，用 that**

    - `例 3`: **All** that glitters is not gold.
      - 这里的先行词是 all，所以用 that 来引导定语从句。另外这里的否定是**半否定**:
        "all ... not ..." 应翻译成"并非都是"，而不是**全否定**的"所有都不"。
      - 译: 闪光的并非都是金子。
    - `例 4`: The book contains **little** that is useful.
      - 这里的先行词是表示否定意义的代词 little，所以用 that 来引导定语从句。
    - `例 5`: There is not **much** that can be done.
      - 这里的先行词是代词 much，所以用 that 来引导定语从句。

3. **先行词是不定代词 something, anything, nothing 和 everything 时，一般用 that**

    `例 7`: I would much rather receive **something** that made me laugh, made
    me reminisce, or fit my personality than **something** that cost a lot but
    that I will just throw in my closet and forget about.

4. **先行词被 any, only, all, every, no, some, much, few, little, 序数词，
   形容词最高级，the only, the one, the very, the right 和 the last
   等成分修饰时，用 that**

    - `例 8`: Tell us **all** things that you know.
    - `例 9`: There is **no** difficult that they can't overcome.
    - `例 10`: The **only** thing that we should do is find our way home.
    - `例 11`: The **very** problem that I want to solve is like this.
    - `例 12`: He is the **only** man that can speak four foreign languages in
      our company.

5. **that 不用在非限制性定语从句中**

    不用 that 引导非限制性定语从句。比如:

    `例 13`: I became a single mother overnight, which is nothing like becoming
    famous overnight.
    - ❌ I became a single mother overnight, **that** is nothing like becoming
      famous overnight.

6. **不能用于介词后面**

    不能在 that 前面使用介词。比如:

    `例 14`:
      - The world in which we live is made up of matter.
      - The world which we live in is made up of matter.
      - The world that we live in is made up of matter.
      - ❌ The world **in that** we live is made up of matter.
