## 4.1 时间状语从句

### 4.1.1 时间连词 when 的用法特点

一般来讲，when 的意思相当于 at that time (在……时刻)，
因此从句的谓语动词通常是**短暂动词**，表示某一时刻的动作。
不过，when 引导的从句也可接**延续动词 (continuous verb)**，这时从句往往用过去进行时态，
表示某一段时间段内发生的动作。

时间状语从句所表达的时间通常是**过去**和**将来**。

when 引导从句表示过去动作有四组时态搭配：

#### 一、主句一般过去时 + 从句一般过去时

- `例 1`: I started my dinner when he left.
  - 他走了之后，我才开始吃晚饭。
- `例 2`: He left when I got there.
  - 我到了以后，他才离开。

若主从句都用一般过去时，则表示**从句动作先发生**。
要强调从句动作先发生，从句还可以用过去完成时：

#### 二、主句一般过去时 + 从句过去完成时

- `例 3`: I started my dinner when he had left.
- `例 4`: He left when I had got there.

用过去完成时，更强调了从句动作先发生。

when 引导的从句还有一个重要的时态搭配，即一般过去时 (simple past)
与过去进行时 (past continuous) 搭配。
**此时的时态搭配与主句、从句没有关系，只与动作的长短有关系。
短暂动作用一般过去时，延续动作用过去进行时。**
这一时态配套使用所表示的意义是：在一个延续背景动作的过程中突然发生了一个短暂动作。

#### 三、主句一般过去时 + 从句过去进行时

`例 5`: The doorbell rang when I was telephoning.

门铃响的时候，我正在打电话。

#### 四、主句过去进行时 + 从句一般过去时

`例 6`: I was telephoning when the doorbell rang.

我当时正在打电话，突然门铃响了。

#### 三与四的对比

由“主句一般过去时 + when + 从句过去进行时”变成“主句过去进行时 + when + 从句一般过去时”，
此时 when 的意思发生了改变，即由 during the time (当……时候) 变成了
at the time (正在那时)。
这时 when 强调某个短暂动作突然发生，所以可以在 when 引导的从句中添加 suddenly 一词。

- `例 7`:
  - ❌ The doorbell rang when ***suddenly*** I was telephoning.
  - ✅ I was telephoning when ***suddenly*** the doorbell rang.
- `例 8`:
  - I was telephoning Harry when she arrived.
    - telephoning 先发生，arrived 后发生。
    - 她到的时候，我正在给哈里打电话。
  - I telephoned Harry when she arrived.
    - arrived 先发生，telephoned 后发生。
    - 她到了以后，我给哈里打了一个电话。
- `例 9`: I was walking along the road when suddenly someone patted me on the
  shoulder from behind.
- `例 10`: On a rainy day I was driving north through Vermont when suddenly I
  noticed a young man holding up a sign reading "Boston".

when 引导从句表示将来动作主要有一种时态搭配：

#### 五、主句一般将来时 + 从句一般现在时

在表示将来的动作时，主句要用**一般将来时 (simple future)**，
而时间状语从句要用**一般现在时 (simple present)** 表示将来，不能使用将来时态。

- `例 11`: I'll speak to him when he arrives.
- `例 12`: I'll tell him about it when he comes back.

### 4.1.2 时间连词 while 的用法特点

当 while 用作时间连词时，意思相当于
**during that time (在……期间)**，表示**某一时间段内发生的动作**。
因此，从句的谓语动词通常是**延续动词**。

- `例 1`: The phone rang while I was taking my bath.
- `例 2`: The doorbell rang while we were watching TV.

时间连词 while 和 when 的含义差别：

- while 相当于 during that time，表示某一时间段内发生的动作，
  从句的谓语动词通常是**延续动词**。
- when 的意思相当于 at that time，从句的谓语动词通常是**短暂动词**，表示某一时刻的动作。
  但从句也可接延续动词，这时从句往往用**过去进行时态**。

`例 3`：A detective arrested a criminal and was about to handcuff him **when** a
huge gust of wind blew the detective's hat off.

"Shall I go and fetch it?" the criminal asked. "Do you take me for a fool?"
asked the detective. "You wait here **while** I ***go*** and ***get*** it!"

`解析`：此句中的 go 和 get 尽管都是短暂动词，但两个动词连用表示的是在一段期间内的活动，
所以用连词 while。而 when 引导的从句的谓语是 blew off，表示“吹落”，显然是一个短暂动作，
所以不能用 while 引导。

`例 4`：I was walking along the road ____ suddenly someone patted me on the
shoulder from behind.

- A. immediately
- B. when
- C. the moment
- D. while

`答案`：B。从句中的动词 patted 是一个短暂动作。

`例 5`：The phenomenon provides a way for companies to remain globally
competitive ____ avoiding market cycles and the growing burdens imposed by
employment rules, healthcare costs and pension plans.

- A. but
- B. while
- C. and
- D. whereas

`答案`：B。这里的动词 avoid 表示一个状态，是延续动词。

### 4.1.3 时间连词 until 的用法特点

until 的用法有以下三个要点：

1. until 既可以用作**介词**也可以用作**连词**，所以 until
   的后面可以接名词短语也可以接时间状语从句。
2. until 的本质思维是表示“一个（主句）动作一直持续到某一个时间点”。即
   **until 前面的主句的谓语必须是延续性的，而 until
   后面接的从句的谓语须是短暂性动词或接时间点**。
3. 根据 `2.`，可得出 until 的句型结构有：
   1. 作为连词引导从句：主句的**延续动词** + until + 从句的**短暂动词**
   2. 作为介词接名词短语：**延续动词** + until + **时间点**

#### 一、延续动词 + until + 短暂动词或时间点

当主句或句子的谓语动词是**延续动词**时，通常用**肯定**形式。
until 的后面若接从句，则从句的谓语必定是短暂动词，或者接表示时间点（point of time）
的名词短语。

- `例 1`：Wait until he comes back.
- `例 2`：Until I came back, he was wating for me at my home.
- `例 3`：We'll stay here until it stops raining.
- `例 5`：I will be away from my office until next Tuesday.

#### 二、短暂动词 + until + 短暂动词或时间点

若主句的谓语动词是**短暂动词**，则要用**否定**形式。
因为否定之后表示的是一个状态，而状态是延续的。这个结构就是 not...until。

- `例 6`：He didn't leave the office until his boss came back.
- `例 7`：I did not realize how special my mother was until I became an adult.
- `例 8`：One will never realize how much and how little he knows until he
  starts talking.
- `例 9`：Ice cream did not reach America until about the middle of the
  eighteenth century.
- `例 10`：I didn't go to bed until 12 o'clock last night.

### 4.1.4 表示“一……就”的结构

#### 一、从句动作先于主句动作

在从句动作发生之后，紧接着主句动作就发生了。表示这一时间关系的**连词**有：

- as soon as
- directly
- immediately
- instantly
- once
- the instant
- the minute
- the moment

这些连词的用法和句式结构是一样的，主从句时态一般一致。

若表示将来的动作，则主句用**一般将来时**（simple future），
从句用**一般现在时**（simple present）表示将来。

- `例 1`：We will leave as soon as it stops raining.

若表示过去的动作，则主句和从句都用**一般过去时**。

- `例 2`：It began to rain as soon as I arrived home.
- `例 3`：The doorbell rang as soon as we began having dinner.

上面例句中的 as soon as 可以换成其他连词：

- `例 4`：It began to rain **immediately** I arrived home.
- `例 5`：The doorbell rang **immediately** we began having dinner.
- `例 6`：A fair-weather friend is like a banker who lends you his umbrella when
  the sun is shining and takes it back **the minute** it rains.
- `例 7`：Don't trust those who leave their friends **the moment** they get into
  difficulty!
- `例 8`：You see the lightning ____ it happens, but you hear the thunder later.
  - A. the instant
  - B. for an instant
  - C. on the instant
  - D. in an instant
  - 答案：A。

#### 二、主句动作先于从句动作

主句动作发生之后，紧接着从句的动作就发生了。表示这一时间关系的连词有：

- hardly...when
- no sooner...than
- scarcely...when

这些连词的用法和句式结构不一样，主从句时态一般也不一致。
它们一般多用来表示过去的动作，此时，主句多用**过去完成时**，且常倒装，从句用**一般过去时**。
可与 as soon as 等从句、主句互换。

- `例 9`：我刚到家，天就开始下起雨来。
  - **No sooner** had I arrived home **than** it began to rain.
  - It began to rain **as soon as** I arrived home.
- `例 10`：
  - A: The floor is awfully wet. What happened?
  - B: **No sooner** had I got into the shower **than** the phone rang.
    - 我刚进去洗澡，突然电话铃就响了。
- `例 11`：**No sooner** had I started to type my paper **than** the telephone
  rang.
  - 我刚开始打我的论文，这时电话铃响了。
- `例 12`：**Hardly** had I arrived home **when** it began to rain.
- `例 16`：**Scarcely** had I started to type my paper **when** the telephone
  rang.

### 思维训练 4.1 时间状语从句

**请选择最佳答案填空。**

*4. I was on the point of going out ____ it began to rain heavily.*

- *A. when*
- *B. while*
- *C. as*
- *D. before*

答案：A。when 在这里表示“突然，意外”的含义。

*7. On a rainy day I was driving north through Vermont ____ I noticed a young
man holding up a sign reading "Boston"*.

- *A. which*
- *B. where*
- *C. when*
- *D. that*

答案：C。
过去进行时 + 一般过去时所表示的意义是：在一个延续背景动作过程中突然发生了一个短暂动作。
Vermont 是州名，如果要改为地点状语从句，应该是 somewhere in Vermont 之类的表达。

## 4.2 地点状语从句

地点状语从句通常由 where 引导，用来表达主句的动作发生的场所。
其结构通常是“where + 陈述句”，从句可以放在句首或句末。

- `例 1`：Stay where you are.
- `例 2`：Generally, air will be heavily polluted where there are factories.
- `例 3`：A driver should slow down where there are schools.

地点状语从句若放在句首，在翻译时往往失去地点的含义，要灵活处理。

- `例 4`：Where there is a will, there is a way.

### 思维训练 4.2 地点状语从句

**请选择最佳答案填空。**

*1. The picture is not hanging ____ it should on the wall.*

- A. until
- B. wherever
- C. where
- D. when

答案：C。从句中省略了 hang，where it should (hang) on the wall.

## 4.3 原因状语从句

### 4.3.1 常见连词的用法

常用的引导原因状语从句的连词有：

- because
- since
- as
- for

这四个连词中，because 的语气最强，只有它才能用来回答 why 的问句，
所引出的原因往往是听话人所不知道的或最感兴趣的；
也只有 because 才能被强调词如 only, just 和 perhaps 等修饰。

- `例 1`：My friends dislike me because I'm handsome and successful.
- `例 2`：Perhaps because most of today's cross-cultural marriages occur because
  of "true love", these couples work hard to overcome their differences.
  - ❌ perhaps for
  - ❌ perhaps as
  - ❌ perhaps since

连词 since 表示人们已知的事实，是不需强调的原因，所以常译成“既然”，通常放在句首。

- `例 3`：Since we don't have class tomorrow, why not go out for a picnic?
- `例 4`：Since you are an English major, I guess you can help me with this
  sentence.

连词 as 与 since 的用法差不多，所引出的理由在说话人看来已经很明显，
或已为听话人所熟悉而不需用 because 加以强调。

- `例 5`：As Monday is a national holiday, all government offices will be
  closed.

连词 for 表示推断的理由，是对前面分句的内容**加以解释或说明**。

- `例 6`：It rained last night, for the ground is wet this morning.
  - 比较：Because it rained last night, the ground is wet this morning.

相比较而言：

- as 和 for 引导的主、从句，二者处于平等位置；
- because 引导的从句显得比主句重要，强调原因；
- since 引导的从句显得次要，而主句重要，以说明将要做什么事。

### 4.3.2 用介词表示因果关系

常用的介词有：

- because of
- due to
- owing to: 常置于句首

因为是介词，所以后面不能接从句。

- `例 1`：We had an accident because he was careless.
- `例 2`：We had an accident due to his carelessness.
- `例 3`：Owing to his carelessness we had an accident.

### 思维训练 4.3 原因状语从句

**请选择最佳答案填空。**

*5. ____ he has had a reputation for being a careful driver, his accident came
as quite a surprise.*

- *A. Since*
- *B. Since that*
- *C. Because*
- *D. For*

答案：A。这里 since 表示众所周知的原因。

## 4.4 目的状语从句

常用的引导目的状语从句的连词有：

- so that
- in order that
- that

此外，在目的状语从句中常含有情态动词：

- may/might
- can/could

例句：

- `例 1`：I turned off the TV **in order that** my roommate could study in
  peace and quiet.
- `例 2`：When I was a child, I would take a flashlight to bed with me
  **so that** I could read comic books without my parent's knowing about it.
- `例 4`：I spoke slowly and clearly **so that/in order that** the audience
  could understand me.
- `例 6`：We climbed high **(so) that** we might get a better view.

从上面例子可以看出，目的状语从句一般位于主句之后。但若要强调目的状语从句，可将 so that 或
in order that 引导的目的状语从句置于句首。

- `例 8`：**In order that** my roommate could study in peace and quiet, I turned
  off the TV.

### 思维训练 4.4 目的状语从句

**请将下列简单句合并成目的状语从句，注意使用情态动词。**

*1. I am going to leave the party early. I want to be able to get a good
night's sleep.*

答案：I am going to leave the party early so that I can get a good night's sleep.

*2. Harry brought his umbrella. He wanted to be sure he didn't get wet.*

答案：Harry brought his umbrella so that he could not get wet.

*6. I put the milk in the refrigerator. I wanted to make sure it didn't spoil.*

答案：I put the milk in the refrigerator so that it wouldn't spoil.

## 4.5 结果状语从句

### 4.5.1 常见连词的用法

常用的引导结果状语从句的连词有：

- so...that
- such...that

⚠️ 结果状语从句都要放在主句之后，而不能提到句首。

> 补充参考：<https://test-english.com/explanation/b1-2/so-such-so-much-so-many/>

#### 一、连词 so...that 的用法

多数结果状语从句是由 so...that 引导的，so 后面接形容词或副词。

1. so + **形容词/副词** + that...
    - `例 2`：The moon is **so** large **that** several million people could
      live there.
    - `例 3`：The food in our school canteen is **so** bad **that** flies go
      there to lose weight.
    - `例 4`：He has put forward unquestioned claims **so** consistently
      **that** he not only believes them himself, but has convinced industrial
      and business management that they are true.
      - 他一直不断地提出确定不疑的主张，以至于不仅他自己对他们深信不疑，
        而且还使得工商管理界相信他们都是真的。
2. so + **形容词** + **a/an** + **单数可数名词** + that...
    - He is **so** good a teacher **that** everyone likes him.
3. so + **many/few** + **复数可数名词** + that...
    - `补充`：He has so many books that I can't count them.
4. so + **much/little** + **不可数名词** + that...
    - `补充`：There was so much food that we couldn't eat it all.

#### 二、连词 such...that 的用法

such...that 引导结果状语从句时，such 后面要接名词（短语）。

公式：such + `(限定词 a/an) + (形容词) + 名词` + that...

1. such + **a/an** + (形容词) + **单数可数名词** + that...
    - `例 6`：Diplomats and crabs are creatures who move in **such** a way
      **that** it is impossible to tell whether they are coming or going.
    - `例 7`：He is **such** a good teacher **that** everyone likes him.
2. such + (形容词) + **复数可数名词** + that...
    - `补充`：They are such interesting books that we all enjoy reading them.
3. such + (形容词) + **不可数名词** + that...
    - `补充`：He shut the window with such force that the glass broke.
    - `补充`：We had such terrible weather that we decided to go back home.

### 4.5.2 结果状语从句的倒装

such/so...that 引导结果状语从句，为了强调，还可以将主句中的 so/such
引导的部分置于句首从而构成倒装结构。

- `例 1`：**So** fast does light travel **that** it is difficult for us to
  imagine its speed.
  - Light travels **so** fast **that** it is difficult for us to imagine its
    speed.
- `例 2`：**So** terrible was the storm **that** the roofs were all ripped off.
  - The storm was **so** terrible **that** the roofs were all ripped off.
- `例 3`：____ that the pilot couldn't fly through it.
  - A. So the storm was severe
  - B. So severe was the storm
  - C. The storm so severe was
  - D. Such was the storm severe
  - 答案：B。
  - The storm was so severe that the pilot couldn't fly through it.
- `例 4`：**Such** a fool was he **that** he believed her.
  - He was **such** a fool **that** he believed her.

### 思维训练 4.5 结果状语从句

**一、请用 so...that 和/或 such...that 合并句子。**

`so + 形容词 + that`

*8. It took us only ten minutes to get there. There was little traffic.*

答案：There was **so** little traffic that it took us only ten minutes to get
there.

`so + little + 不可数名词 + that`

often have to force them to break for sports and games.*

- *A. became the children*
- *B. become the children*
- *C. had the children become*
- *D. do the children become*

答案：D。C 选项时态不对，因为从句谓语是一般现在时态的 have to，不可能与过去完成时态搭配。

*13. It is ____ weather that I would like to go to the beach.*

- *A. so nice*
- *B. such nice*
- *C. such a nice*
- *D. so nice a*

- `例 3`：Today if a happy smile comes to you, a happy smile that perhaps you
  can't explain...it is because at that moment, I am thinking of you, and
  smiling, too.
  - 假如今天你不经意间开心地微笑起来，连你都无法解释自己为什么会笑……
    这是因为此时此刻我正在想你，我也在微笑。
- `例 4`：In politics, if you want someone to make a speech, ask a man; if you
  want something done, ask a woman.
- `例 5`：Please do not post any private information unless you want it to be

- `例 6`：Discussions about "face" can be difficult if one is not familiar with
  the significance and importance attached to it by many Asian people. It does
  have different meanings to different people and, unless a teacher is
  "comfortable" with broaching the subject, it is best left alone.
  - 亚洲人非常看重“面子”问题，如果你对此不熟悉的话，讨论“面子”问题就会很困难。
    对于不同的人，“面子”问题的意思是不同的，除非作为老师，你很善于把握这个话题，
    否则还是不要涉及为好。
- `例 7`：Read silently. Do not make a sound, move your tongue or lips. Reading
  aloud slows you down and will not help pronunciation unless you have a mentor
  who will correct your pronunciation.
- `例 8`：Inside this book you will find a series of successful skills,
  strategies and suggestions for improving your English, but these will be

## 4.7 让步状语从句

### 4.7.1 常见连词的用法

常见的引导让步状语从句的词有 though, although, even though, even if。
此时，**主句前不可用 but，但可用 yet 或 still**。
