## 1. 完全倒装

完全倒装：将**谓语全部**放在主语之前。

常见形式：将用作状语的介词短语，尤其是表示地点的介词短语，放在句首，将谓语动词放在主语之前而构成完全倒装。

- `例 1`：Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the
  United States **came** those who had no intention to stay, and who would make
  some money and then go home.
  - Those who had no intention to stay, and who would make some money and then
    go home **came** along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home
    in the United States.
- `例 2`：Among the commission's 51 members **are** top-tier-university
  presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as
  prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music, and journalism.
  - Top-tier-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business
    executives, as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music,
    and journalism **are** among the commission's 51 members.

## 2. 部分倒装

部分倒装：只将**助动词**放在主语的前面，谓语的其余部分放在主语的后面，就是部分倒装。

### 2.1 句首是否定词或否定意义的词组

常见的词有：hardly, little, never, no, not only, scarcely

- `例 1`：Not only **did** they develop such a device but by the turn of the
  millenium they had also managed to embed it in a world wide system accessed by
  billions of people every day.
  - They not only developed such a device but by the turn of the millenium they
    had also managed to embed it in a world wide system accessed by billions of
    people every day.

### 2.2 only 出现在句首修饰介词短语、副词、状语从句时，主句要部分倒装

- `例 1`：Only when human began to get its food in a more productive way
  **was** there time for other things.
  - When human began to get its food in a more productive way there **was**
    time for other things.

### 2.3 比较状语从句中的部分倒装

由 than 或 as 引导的比较状语从句中，有时会将从句中的助动词、系动词或情态动词前置到较长的名词主语之前，以保持结构平衡。

- `例 1`：Those forced to exercise their smiling muscles reacted more
  enthusiastically to funny cartoons than **did** those whose mouths were
  contracted in a frown, suggesting that expressions may influence emotions
  rather than just the other way around.
  - Those forced to exercise their smiling muscles reacted more
    enthusiastically to funny cartoons than those whose mouths were contracted
    in a frown **reacted to funnny cartoons**, suggesting that expressions may
    influence emotions rather than just the other way around.

### 2.4 so 与 such 引导的结果状语从句的倒装

- `例 1`：So poor in one sense **was** it that he never could remember for more
  than a few days a single date or a line of poetry.
  - It **was** so poor in one sense that he never could remember for more than a
    few days a single date or a line of poetry.

## 3. 强调

强调是有效表达思想的手段之一。常用的手段有语法手段，词汇手段，修辞手段，以及语音手段。

### 3.1 强调谓语

使用助动词 do, does, did

- `例 1`：Science never has all answers. But science **does** provide us with
  the best available guide to the future.

### 3.2 强调其他成分：it + is/was + 被强调的部分 + that/who

- `例 1`：**It is the playgoers**, the ESC contends, **who** bring in much of
  the town's revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five
  nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants.
