## 2. 过去将来进行时 (would/should be doing)

例：The government promised that a new highway would be being built next July.
（政府承诺说第二年7月将有一条新的高速公路正在修建。）
（此句的时间状语是具体的将来时间，所以最好用将来进行时。）（此句为被动语态）

## 4. 过去将来完成进行时 (would/should have been doing)

例：They said that by the end of the following month,
the project would have been being worked for 3 years.
（他们说到第二个月底为止，这项工程就已经不停地进行了3年了。）
