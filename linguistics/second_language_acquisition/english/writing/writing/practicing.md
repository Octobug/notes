Dear Jack,

    I am writing this letter to thank you (for congratulating me) and to give
you some advice on translation.

    Regarding the translation, there are several points I would like to mention.
First of all, it's advisable to put things into perspective and establish a
correct value about translation primarily. What's more, you could look for
advanced experiences in this aspect on Zhihu Community. In addition, a practical
and reasonable study plan should be promptly carried out and remain high on your
agenda. For more details, you could refer to the attachment below.

    I would be glad if you found the suggestions mentioned above helpful. Should
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

                                                                    Yours truly,
                                                                        Li Ming
