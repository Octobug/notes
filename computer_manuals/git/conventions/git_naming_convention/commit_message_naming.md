# Git Naming Convention > Commit Message Naming

> <https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/blob/master/git/commit-message-naming.md>

Consist of two parts:

- Subject: Short informative summary of the commit
- Body: More detailed explanatory text if needed

## Subject:

- Short and descriptive (max 50 chars)
- Capitalized
- In imperative present tense
- Not end with period

Example:

```git
Implement access right management
```

## Body:

- Separated with a blank line from the subject
- Explain what, why, etc.
- Max 72 chars
- Each paragraph capitalized

Example:

```git
Implement proper authorization for each service on development phase to validate
during the API call.

Access right management is used to check proper authorization to access an API
by an employee or the employer.
```

## Conventional Commits

Commit messages **MAY** use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/)
format. It provides guidelines to create a better commit history log, making
easier to have automated tasks around it (e.g. automated changelogs). Commits
would follow the format `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`, where `<type>`
might be `feat`/`fix`/`chore`/`docs` etc. and breaking changes are indicated on
the beginning of the optional body or footer section.

Example:

```sh
git commit -m "feat(survey): add nps survey to the home page

BREAKING CHANGE:  `survey` objects in xml file have been re-used in the global
configurations.
```

Please refer to [Conventional Commits docs](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/)
for more details.
