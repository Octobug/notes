This pull request is part of the work to make it easier for people to
contribute to naming convention guides. One of the easiest way to make small
changes would be using the Edit on Github button.

To achieve this, we needed to:

- Find the best Gitbook plugin which can do the work
- Integrate it in all the pages to redirect the user to the right page on
  GitHub for editing
- Make it visible on the page so users can notice it easily
```
