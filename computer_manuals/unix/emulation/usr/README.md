## Digests

> In current Unices (the plural of unix), `/usr` is where user-land programs
> and data (as opposed to 'system land' programs and data) are. The name hasn't
> changed, but it's meaning has narrowed and lengthened from "everything user
> related" to "user usable programs and data". As such, some people may now
> refer to this directory as meaning 'User System Resources' and not 'user' as
> was originally intended.
