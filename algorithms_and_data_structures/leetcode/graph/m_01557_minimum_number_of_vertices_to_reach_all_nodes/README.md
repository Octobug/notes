# 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes

> <https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes/>

Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to
`n-1`, and an array `edges` where $edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]$ represents a
directed edge from node $from_i$ to node $to_i$.

Find *the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are
reachable*. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

**Example 1**:

```txt
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
Output: [0,3]
Explanation: It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex.
From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output
    [0,3].
```

**Example 2**:

```txt
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other
    node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1
    and 4.
```

**Constraints**:

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- $0 <= from_i, to_i < n$
- All pairs $(from_i, to_i)$ are distinct.
