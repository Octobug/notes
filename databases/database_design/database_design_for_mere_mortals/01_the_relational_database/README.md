## What is a Database?

Two types of databases in database management are:

1. **operational databases**: where data is stored and processed in real-time.
2. **analytical databases**: where historical and time-dependent data are stored
   and tracked.

## The Relational Database

### Retrieving Data

SQL: Structured Query Language, SQL is the standard language used to create,
modify, maintain, and query relational databases.

### Advantages of a Relational Database

- **Built-in multilevel integrity**: Data integrity is built into the database
  at the
  - field level: to ensure the accuracy of the data;
  - table level: to ensure that records are not duplicated and to detect
    missing primary key values;
  - relationship level: to ensure that the relationship between a pair of
    tables is valid;
  - business level: to ensure that the data is accurate in terms of the
    business itself.
- **Logical and physical data independence from database applications**
- **Guaranteed data consistency and accuracy**
- **Easy data retrieval**

### Relational Database Management Systems

- Q. Name one of the branches of mathematics on which the relational model is
  based.

    A. The relational model is based on two branches of mathematics—set theory
    and first-order predicate logic.”

- Q. Name the three types of relationships in a relational database.

    A. One-to-one, One-to-many, Many-to-many
