## The Purpose of this Book

Database development process has three phases:

1. **Logical design**: The first phase involves determining and defining tables
   and their fields, establishing primary and foreign keys, establishing table
   relationships, and determining and establishing the various levels of data
   integrity.
2. **Physical implementation**: The second phase entails creating the tables,
   establishing key fields and table relationships, and using the proper tools
   to implement the various levels of data integrity.
3. **Application development**: The third phase involves creating an
   application that allows a single user or group of users to interact with the
   data stored in the database. The application development phase itself can be
   divided into separate processes, such as determining end-user tasks and
   their appropriate sequences, determining information requirements for report
   output, and creating a menu system for navigating the application.
