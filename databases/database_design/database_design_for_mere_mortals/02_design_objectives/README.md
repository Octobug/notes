## Why Should You Be Concerned with Database Design

It is crucial to the consistency, integrity, accuracy of the data in a database.

## The Importance of Theory

The relational database is based on two branches of mathematics known as
*set theory* (集合论) and *first-order predicate logic* (一阶逻辑).

Theory describes the basic building blocks used to create a relational database
and provides guidelines for how it should be arranged. Arranging building
blocks to achieve a desired result is defined as design.

## Objectives of Good Design

- The database supports both required and ad hoc information retrieval.
- The tables are constructed properly and efficiently.
- Data integrity is imposed at the field, table, and relationship levels.
- The database supports business rules relevant to the organization.
- The database lends itself to future growth.

## Benefits of Good Design

- The database structure is easy to modify and maintain.
- The data is easy to modify.
- Information is easy to retrieve.
- End-user applications are easy to develop and build.

## Database-Design Methods
