The relational model is still going strong and for many reasons:

- Databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle, amongst
  many others, are still widely used, discussed, and actively developed.
- Knowing how to run SQL queries remains a highly sought-after skill for
  software engineers, data analyst, and others.
- There remains a vast universe of use cases for which a relational database is
  still beyond any reasonable doubt the way to go.
