Similar to a medical standards of care (e.g., having a colonoscopy starting at
age 50 and regular blood pressure and bone density tests), certain age-based
milestones tell people key actions to take at different ages.

The following financial activities often take place at various decades of a
person's life:

- 20s and 30s- Debt repayment and household formation
- 40s and 50s- Peak earnings and wealth accumulation
- 60s- Preparation for retirement and retirement
- 70s and Above- Transitions and wealth distribution

Especially during later life, there are many age-related financial milestones.
For example, at age 59 ½, people are eligible to make withdrawals from a
traditional IRA or tax-deferred employer retirement savings plan without paying
a 10% penalty and, at age 65, they are eligible to claim Medicare benefits.
Like medical milestones, which are generally determined by scientific research
(e.g., clinical trials), financial milestones are grounded in research and
facts, typically tax laws and other government policies.

Want to improve your personal finances? Search the words “Financial Milestones
for Adults” online and find articles that describe the age-related financial
milestones that apply to you. Although actual timing will vary from person to
person, below are some suggested financial milestones to achieve during each
decade of adult life. Milestones achieved at an earlier age (e.g., a good
credit score and an adequate emergency fund) should continue during subsequent
years.

## Age 30

- Financial independence from parents (e.g., independent living arrangements
  and no “subsidies” to pay household expenses such as insurance premiums and
  cell phone bills)
- Student loan debt completely repaid or close to repayment (e.g., standard
  10-year repayment plan)
- A year's worth of salary (1x) saved for retirement
- A good credit history established with a credit score in the low- to mid-700s
  or higher
- Regular saving/investing and at least three to six months of income set aside
  for emergencies
- Educational credentials earned or near completion (e.g., certifications and
  graduate/professional degrees)
- Have current estate planning documents and life insurance to protect
  dependents or co-signers, if applicable

## Age 40

- Three times annual salary (3x) saved for retirement; saving at least 15% of
  gross income
- College savings established for children, if applicable
- Increased investing expertise and diversification of investment portfolio
  assets
- Increased human capital (i.e., job skills and knowledge) to remain employable
  and earn promotions/raises

## Age 50

- Six times annual salary (6x) saved for retirement; making catch-up retirement
  savings plan contributions
- Increased knowledge about the specifics of Social Security, Medicare, and
  employer retirement benefits
- Increased knowledge of aging parents' finances and communication about
  caregiving-related issues
- Use of financial advisers, as needed, as net worth increases and finances
  become more complex

## Age 60

- Eight times annual salary (8x) saved for retirement

  “second act” job or volunteer role
