## Getting help

### The Docker forums

### Docker on IRC

[Freenode IRC network](https://freenode.net/)

### Docker on GitHub

## Reporting issues for Docker

## Setting up a build environment

### Install Docker

### Install source and build tools

### Check out the source

### Contributing to the documentation

- <https://github.com/docker/docs>

### Build the environment

```sh
# building the docker environment
make build

# building the docker binary
make binary
```

### Running the tests

```sh
make test
```

This command will create a development image. A container will be launched from
this image, and the test will run inside it.

ðŸ’¡ You can use the `$TESTFLAGS` environment variable to pass in arguments to the
test run.

### Use Docker inside our development environment

```sh
# launching an interactive session
make shell
```

### Submitting a pull request

### Merge approval and maintainers

- `LGTM` (Looks Good To Me)
