ðŸ’¡ Tips: Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows are a collection of components.
It includes a tiny **virtual machine** shipped with a **wrapper script** to
manage it. The virtual machine runs the daemonn and provides a local Docker
daemon on OS X and Microsoft Windows. The Docker client binary, `docker`, is
installed natively on these platforms and connected to the Docker daemon running
in the virtual machine.

ðŸ’¡ Tips: Using `Puppet` and `Chef` to install Docker are recommended rather than
using a manual process.
