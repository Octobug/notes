# Getting Started

## Setting up your computer

I'll never intentionally break the law in (or out of) my job (or in anywhere).
So I only have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
installed on my personal computer.

Here is an alternative based on [Podman](https://podman.io) that is available
for commercial use.
