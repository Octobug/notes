The first definition of a protocol, according to the *New Oxford American
Dictionary*, is

> The official procedure or system of rules governing affairs of state or
> diplomatic occasions.

A collection of related protocols is called a ***protocol suite***.

The design that specifies how various protocols of a protocol suite relate to
each other and devide up tasks to be accomplished is called the
***architecture*** or ***reference model*** for the protocol suite.

TCP/IP is a protocol suite that implements the Internet architecture and draws
its origins from the ***ARPANET Reference Model*** (ARM).

## Architectural Principles

- WAN: wide area network

### The Internet vs. the World Wide Web

- We refer to the Internet in terms of its ability to provide basic
  communication of messages between computers.
- We refer to WWW as an application that uses the Internet for communication.

### The goals of the Internet Architecture

The primary goal: **develop an effective technique for multiplexed utilization
of existing interconnected networks**.

The second-level goals are:

- Internet communication must continue despite loss of networks or gateways.
- The Internet must support multiple types of communication services.
- The Internet architecture must accommodate a variety of networks.
