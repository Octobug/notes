英语正常的语序是主语在谓语前面，所谓倒装，就是把谓语提前，或部分提前到主语前面，形成倒装结构。

倒装句魅力展示：

## Sonnet 18 by William Shakespeare

Sometime **too hot** the eye of heaven shines,

**And often is his** gold complexion dimmed,

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,

**Nor shall death** brag thou wander'st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,

**So long lives this**, and this gives life to thee.

```txt
有时天空之巨眼目光太炽热，
它金灿灿的面色也常被遮暗；
而千芳万艳都终将凋零飘落，
被时运天道之更替剥尽红颜；
但你永恒的夏天将没有止尽，
你所拥有的美貌也不会消失，
终难夸口你游荡于死荫，
当你在不朽的诗中永葆盛时；
只要有人类生存，或人有眼睛，
我的诗就会流传并赋予你生命。
```

不同语法书对于倒装结构采用了不同的归纳分类方法。
这里结合了《英语语法新思维》、《经典英语语法》、《英语兔 - 语法 - 倒装句》的内容，尽可能简洁、全面地归类倒装结构。

## 1. 完全倒装

> Full Inversion

完全倒装：将句子中的**谓语动词完全**置于主语之前。

### 1.1 副词、介词短语在句首的倒装

将用作状语的副词、介词短语（尤其是表**地点**）置于句首，并将谓语动词放在主语之前而构成完全倒装。
这里又分为以下几种情况：

#### 1.1.1 地点、时间和表运动的副词在句首的倒装

这类地点副词有 here, there 等。

`1`: Here is your coffee.

- Your coffee is here.

`2`: Here comes the bus.

- The bus comes here.

这类时间副词有 now, then 等。

`3` Now comes the wolf's turn!

- The wolf's turn comes.

`4` Now is the best time to visit Tokyo.

这类副词有 in, out, up, down, away, ahead 等。

`5` In rushed the students.

`6` Out rushed a missile from under the bomber.

`7` Up went the carrots into the air.

`8` Away flows my youth.

`9` Ahead sat an old woman.

⚠️ 这一类倒装结构主语必须是**名词**，如果是人称代词则不能完全倒装。

`10` Here he comes.

`11` Away they went.

#### 1.1.2 介词短语在句首的倒装

`1`: In the classroom are sitting many students.

- Many students are sitting in the classroom.

`2`: On top of the mountain stands a tall pine.

- A tall pine stands on top of the mountain.

`3`: At the table sat a rabbit.

`4`: Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the United
States **came** those who had no intention to stay, and who would make some
money and then go home.

- Those who had no intention to stay, and who would make some money and then go
  home **came** along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in
  the United States.

`5`: Among the commission's 51 members **are** top-tier-university presidents,
scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as prominent
figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music, and journalism.

- Top-tier-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business
  executives, as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music,
  and journalism **are** among the commission's 51 members.

### 1.2 主语补语（表语）的倒装

即对“主系表”结构的倒装。
为了保持句子平衡（尤其是“长主语”）或强调表语部分，将作表语的形容词、分词、介词短语、such
置于句首时，需要完全倒装。

#### 1.2.1 正常主系表结构的倒装

`1` Such were the wolf's tricks.

- 这就是大灰狼的把戏。

`2` More serious is the problem of how environmental pollution will affect our
life.

- The problem of how environmental pollution will affect our life is more
  serious.
- 这里的主语包含一个从句，依照“尾重原则”，可以把句子倒装，使“长主语”后置。

`3` Especially significant was his view of freedom, which, for him, was
associated with the rights and responsibilities of the individual: he advocated
freedom of thought and of personal expression.

`4` Adding to a woman's increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased
"opportunities" for stress. [2008 年阅读 text 1]

- `译` 给女性增加更多压力化学物质剂量的是：她们有更多面临压力的机会。

#### 1.2.2 可作形容词的过去/现在分词的倒装

`1` Seated on the ground is a group of rabbits.

- 席地而坐的是一群兔子。

`2` Running fast is a young man, who tries to catch the train.

`3` Vividly depicted in this novel is a boy, who fights the evil wizard.

## 2. 部分倒装

> Partial Inversion

部分倒装：仅将**助动词**提前置于主语前面，谓语的其余部分放在主语的后面，就是部分倒装。
部分倒装往往是为了将状语提前，以强调状语。

### 2.1 句首为否定词或否定意义词组的倒装

常见的词有：

- at no time
- by no means
- hardly
- in no way
- little
- never
- no
- not
- not only
- not until
- scarcely
- seldom

`1` Never before have I seen you.

- I have never seen you before.

`2` Hardly do I attend the grammar class.

`3` By no means will he tell a lie.

`4` Hardly had I got to the station when the train left.

`5` No sooner had I got to the station than the train left.

`6` Not only did he complain, but also he refused to pay.

`7` No longer will this terrible thing happen.

`8` Nowhere else can you find a cheaper stuff like this.

`9` Seldom does he come here.

`10` Not only **did** they develop such a device but by the turn of the
millenium they had also managed to embed it in a world wide system accessed by
billions of people every day.

- They not only developed such a device but by the turn of the millenium they
  had also managed to embed it in a world wide system accessed by billions of
  people every day.

`11` Television is one of the means by which these feelings are created and
conveyed -- and perhaps never before has it served so much to connect different
peoples and nations as is the recent events in Europe.

⚠️ 当 not until 引出主从复合句，**主句倒装，从句不倒装**。

`12` Not until the exam came did I realize the danger.

- 状语从句：until the exam came

`13` Not until I saw the score did I realize I hadn't worked hard.

- I didn't realize I hadn't worked hard until I saw the score.

### 2.2 only 在句首修饰副词、介词短语、状语从句时主句的部分倒装

在英语中，状语可以是：

1. 副词
2. 介词短语
3. 非谓语动词
4. 形容词短语
5. 状语从句

但是在倒装结构中，能倒装的只有 only 在句首修饰副词、介词短语、状语从句的情况。

`1` Only when human began to get its food in a more productive way **was**
there time for other things.

- When human began to get its food in a more productive way there **was** time
  for other things.

`2` Only gradually can we succeed.

- We can succeed only gradually.

`3` Only in this way can we succeed.

`4` Only when/if effective measures are taken can this problem be solved.

`5` Only gradually was the by-product of the institution noted, and only more
gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct
of the institution.

- 这里是两个并列的部分倒装句。
  - the by-product...was noted only gradually
  - this effect was considered as a...only more gradually still
- `译` 机构附带产生的影响只有逐渐地才能被注意到；而这种影响被视为机构运作的指导性因素的过程则更加缓慢。

### 2.3 比较状语从句中的部分倒装

由 than 或 as 引导的比较状语从句中，有时会将从句中的助动词、系动词或情态动词前置到较长的名词主语之前，以保持结构平衡。

- `1`：Those forced to exercise their smiling muscles reacted more
  enthusiastically to funny cartoons than **did** those whose mouths were
  contracted in a frown, suggesting that expressions may influence emotions
  rather than just the other way around.
  - Those forced to exercise their smiling muscles reacted more
    enthusiastically to funny cartoons than those whose mouths were contracted
    in a frown **reacted to funnny cartoons**, suggesting that expressions may
    influence emotions rather than just the other way around.

### 2.4 so 与 such 引导的结果状语从句的倒装

`1`: So quickly did he run that I couldn't catch up.

`2`: So poor in one sense **was** it that he never could remember for more than
a few days a single date or a line of poetry.

  few days a single date or a line of poetry.

`3`: So quick was he that I couldn't catch up.

### 2.5 “if...should...”构成虚拟语气的倒装

`2` A: I was afraid.

B: So was I. (= I was afraid, too.)

`3` The rabbit can't ride a bicycle, neither/nor can the wolf.

## 3. 形式倒装

### 3.1 感叹句中的倒装

`1` What a delicious carrot it is!

### 3.2 比较级句型中的倒装

`1` The more carrots you eat, the healthier you become.

- If you eat more carrots, you will become healthier.

### 3.3 however, whatever 引导让步状语从句时的倒装

`1` However long this video is, you should watch it till the end.

### 3.4 as, though 引导让步状语从句时的倒装

`1` Much as he likes the carrot, he doesn't want to eat it.
