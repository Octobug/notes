动名词的构成即是在动词后面加 `-ing`，构成 doing 的形式。
它在意义上相当于一个名词，但同时又保留动词的特征。
说它相当于一个名词，是因为它在句中主要充当名词可以充当的成分，比如**主语、宾语、表语或定语**。
说它保留动词的特征，是因为它可以**有自己的宾语，有自己的时态和语态变化，还可保留自己的逻辑主语**。

## 1. 动名词的作用（一）：作主语

与不定式作主语不同，动名词作主语一般直接放在句首，谓语动词用**单数**。
只有在某些特定句型中才会把动名词放在句末作主语，句首用 it 形式主语来指代，类似于不定式作主语的结构。

### 1.1 动名词位于句首作主语

动名词作主语一般直接放在句首，谓语动词用单数。

`1` Hating people is like burning down your own house to get rid of a rat.

- 句子主语是 hating people 这个动名词短语，而不是 people。
- `译` 憎恨别人，就好像为了赶走一只老鼠而把自己的房子烧掉。

`2` Getting mad at others means other people are getting control of your
emotions!

- `译` 生别人的气就意味着让别人控制了你的情绪！

`3` Using the mass media to point the finger at China will not help get the
global deal we need to avert climate change disaster. Not only have rich
countries historically caused the problem, but they are also importing emissions
from the developing world.

- 利用大众传媒对中国横加指责，无助于达成我们制止气候变化灾难所需的全球协议。
  富国不仅在历史上是这一问题的始作俑者，它们现在也正在从发展中国家进口排放权。

`4`

- A: I studied French in high school but I never really learned it until I spent
  the summer in Paris.
- B: Really using a language makes all the difference, doesn't it?

  - `译` A: 我是在高中时学习法语的，但直到上次去巴黎过了一个夏天我才觉得我真的学会了。
    B: 真正去使用一门外语感觉完全不一样，对吧？

`5` Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength; while loving someone
deeply gives you courage.

- `译` 被爱给你力量；爱人给你勇气。

`6` No man is an isolated island. Your circle of friends is there to give you
moral support. Spending time and engaging in worthwhile activities with them
could give you a very satisfying feeling. Nothing feels better than having group
support.

- `译` 没有人是一座孤岛，因为你有自己的朋友圈子，这会给你精神上的支持。
  和朋友待在一起，参加一些有意义的活动，这可以给你一种非常满足的感觉。
  没有什么比能获得团体的支持让你感觉更好的了。

### 1.2 动名词谓语句末作主语

把动名词放在句末作主语一般仅限于某些特定句型。

#### 一、it is no good/no use doing sth

表示“干某事没有用”。这里的 it 是形式主语，真正的主语是句末的动名词短语 doing sth.。
其中，no good 可以替换为 any/some good, any/some/no use 以及 a waste of time 等。

`1` It's no use crying over spilt milk.

- `=` Crying over spilt milk is no use.
- `译` 后悔没有用。

`2` It's no use talking to that parrot.

- `译` 跟那个鹦鹉说话没用。

#### 二、there is no point/use/good (in) doing sth

表示“干某事没有必要/意义”，“干某事没用”。

`8` There is no point in my going out to date someone. I might really like if I
met him at the time, but who, right now, has no chance of being anything to me
but a transitional man.

- `译` 现在让我出去和人约会没有用。如果我碰上了意中人，我自然会爱上他的。可是在现在这个时候我跟谁也不会有结果的，除非是为了解解闷。

`9` There is no use your arguing with him.

- `译` 你没必要和他争论。

`11` There's little use in hurrying to get there.

- `译` 没有必要这么匆匆忙忙地赶过去。

#### 三、there is no doing sth

相当于 it's impossible to do sth. 或 we can't do sth.，表示“不可能做某事”。

`12` There is no telling what will happen tomorrow.

- `译` 谁也无法预知明天会发生什么。

`13` There's no knowing the future.

## 2. 动名词的作用（二）：作宾语

动名词主要就是放在某些特定的动词或者介词后面作宾语，此外还可以用在某些特定句型结构中。

### 2.1 在动词后面作宾语

在这些动词（短语）后面一般要用动名词作宾语：

- admit, advise, anticipate, appreciate, avoid
- consider, contemplate
- delay, deny, detest, discuss, dislike
- encourage, endure, enjoy, escape, excuse

the last three years.

`9` I will overlook your being so rude to my sister this time but don't let it
happen again.

- overlook 后面接了物主代词 your，再接动名词 being，两者一起构成动名词的复合结构 your
  being...，其中 your 是动名词 being 的逻辑主语。
- `译` 这次你对我妹妹态度粗鲁就算了，但下不为例。

### 2.2 在介词后面作宾语

介词后面不能直接用动词原形作宾语，必须改为动名词。
不过，由于 to 可以是不定式的小品词，所以后面可以接动词原形。
因此在遇到 to 时，必须分清它是作为介词还是作为不定式的符号。

介词 to 短语后面必须接动名词，常见的有：

- amount to doing
- be accustomed to do/doing
- be averse to doing
- be/get used to doing
- be devoted to doing
- be dedicated to doing
- be opposed to doing
- dedicate...to doing
- devote...to doing
- get round to doing
- in addition to doing
- look forword to doing
- object to doing
- prefer doing to doing
- take to doing
- the alternative/approach/solution to doing

`1` I am looking forword to hearing from you.

`2` I am used to sleeping with the lights on.

`3`

- I am accustomed to sleeping with the lights on.
- I am accustomed to sleep with the lights on.

`4` The students object to increasing their tuition.

- `译` 学生反对提高学费。

`5` After a long delay I finally got round to making inquiries into the matter.

- `译` 拖了很长时间以后，我才终于抽出时间来过问这件事。

`6` As an alternative to using a single-occupancy vehicle, carpooling involves
two to five commuters sharing a vehicle.

- an alternative to 里的 to 是介词，后面接动名词 using。
  另外，involve 后面接了动名词的复合结构 two to five commuters sharing a vehicle，其中
  two to five commuters 充当动名词 sharing a vehicle 的逻辑主语。
- `译` 作为单人驾车之外的选择，拼车是指两到五个通勤者共乘一辆车。

### 2.3 在特定的句型中作宾语

英语中有很多固定的句型结构要求接动名词作宾语。

#### 一、“做某事遇到了麻烦/困难”

improve our conversation and listening skills.

`8` They turn the volume up full blast and begin to party. The music is so loud
that we have a hard time carrying on a conversation without raising our voices.

`9` I have learned, however, that change always seems more difficult at the
outside, and if I work hard at remaining positive and view changes as
opportunities to grow, I have an easier time dealing with them.

- can't choose but do
- can't help but do

#### 三、其他句型结构

还有其他一些短语，比如 be worth doing, be busy doing。这类短语用主动形式表示被动的意思。
be worth doing 可以转为其他句型结构：be worth of being done/to be done。

`12` The book is worth reading.

- The book is worthy of being read.
- The book is worthy to be read.
