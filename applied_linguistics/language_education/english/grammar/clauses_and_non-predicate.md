从句的简化是指把结构复杂的从句简化为精炼的非谓语形式。

## 1. 名词从句的简化

名词从句是属于名词性的，而英文中的三大非谓语只有动名词和不定式具有名词的特征。
因此，属于名词类的名词从句自然可以被简化成两种形式——动名词和不定式。

### 1.1 名词从句与动名词

- 由 that 引导的名词从句（由陈述句变化而来）一般简化成动名词来表达，通常采用**动名词**复合结构的形式；
- 由 whether 或 what 等疑问词引导的名词从句（由一般疑问句或特殊疑问句变化而来）一般简化为**不定式**。

#### 一、that 引导的主语从句与动名词

直接用动名词的复合结构来替换主语从句，放在句首作主语。

`1` 约翰赢得了马拉松比赛，这真让我们吃惊。

- It surprised us that John won the marathon.
- That John won the marathon surprised us.
- John's winning the marathon surprised us.
  - John won the marathon `=>` John's winning the marathon

`2` 他在比赛中失利，这让每个人都觉得很意外。

- That he lost the game came as a surprise to everybody.
- His losing the game came as a surprise to everybody.

#### 二、that 引导的痛谓语从句与动名词

简化 that 引导的同位语从句时，也是变同位语从句为一个动名词的复合结构。
不过，由于英语中没有“名词 + 动名词”这样的结构，所以要在同位语从句修饰的名词后面加上一个介词，来连接名词与动名词，同时表达同位语关系。
这里的介词通常是用 of，偶尔可以用 about 等其他介词。
句子由原来的同位语从句结构“名词 + that 同位语从句”变成一个动名词结构“名词 + of + 动名词复合结构”。

`3` 戴维不可能从战场上生还。

- There was no chance that Davy would come from the battle alive.
- There was no chance of Davy coming from the battle alive.
  - that Davy would come from the battle alive `=>` of Davy coming from the
    battle alive，这里 of 表示同位说明关系。

`4` 听到中国又发射了一颗人造卫星的消息，我们都受到极大的鼓舞。

- We were greatly encouraged by the news that China had launched another
  man-made satellite.
- We were greatly encouraged by the news of China having launched another
  man-made satellite.

`5` 任何人只要稍稍看一眼目前的失业数据就能知道，有关经济复苏即将到来的断言是不符合事实的。

- Anyone with half an eye on the unemployment figures knew that the assertion
  that economic recovery would be just around the corner was untrue.
- Anyone with half an eye on the unemployment figures knew that the assertion
  about economic recovery being just around the corner was untrue.

#### 三、that 引导的宾语从句与动名词

由 that 引导的宾语从句的简化比较复杂，因为它可以转化为动名词，也可以转化为不定式，这主要与主句谓语动词的用法密切相关。

`6` 我在考虑将来移民到美国。

- I consider that I will emigrate to America in the future.
- I consider emigrating to America in the future.
  - consider 后面要接动名词，不能接不定式，因此要简化为动名词。

有的主句谓语动词后面需要加一个介词，然后才能接动名词作宾语。

`7` 简的妈妈坚持要求她和她哥哥一起去游泳。

- Jane's mother insisted that she should go swimming with her brother.
- Jane's mother insisted on her going swimming with her brother.
  - insist 是不及物动词，后面要接介词 on 之后才能接宾语。

`8` 我希望能够开着自己的车去上班。

- I hope that I can drive to work in my own car.
- I hope to drive to work in my own car.
  - hope 后面要接不定式，不能接动名词。

综上，宾语从句是简化为动名词还是不定式，完全取决于主句谓语动词。

*7. Trying sending his girlfriend flowers every day is the only way he can think
of to gain her favor.

*10. Nowhere in nature is aluminum found free, owing to its always being

### 1.2 名词从句与不定式

由 whether 或 what 等疑问词引导的名词从句一般简化为不定式，其中主要是宾语从句简化为一个带有相应连词的不定式。
此时的宾语从句中往往含有情态动词，常见的有 should, can/could。

`1` 她还无法决定，应该和他一起去还是就待在家里。

- She can't decide whether she should go with him or stay home.
- She can't decide whether to go with him or (to) stay home.
  - 这里的不定式具有“应该”的情态意义。

`2` 我还没有决定是否应该给克林特投票。

- I haven't decided whether I should vote for Clint.
- I haven't decided whether to vote for Clint.

`3` 我不知道该做什么。

- I don't know what I should do.
- I don't know what to do.
  - 这里的不定式具有“应该”的情态意义。

`4` 请告诉我去汽车站怎么走。

- Please tell me how I can get to the bus station.
- Please tell me how to get to the bus station.
  - 这里的不定式具有“能够”的情态意义。
