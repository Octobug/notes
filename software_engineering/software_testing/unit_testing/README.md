### Spy

* A spy is a fake function that keeps track of arguments, returns value, the
  value of this and exception is thrown (if any) for all its calls.

### Stub

* A stub is a spy with predetermined behavior.
* We can use a stub to:
  * Take a predetermined action, like throwing an exception
  * Provide a predetermined response
  * Prevent a specific method from being called directly (especially when it
    triggers undesired behaviors like HTTP requests)

### Mock

* A mock is a fake function (like a spy) with pre-programmed behavior (like a
  stub) as well as pre-programmed expectations.
* We can use a mock to:
  * Verify the contract between the code under test and the external methods
    that it calls
  * Verify that an external method is called the correct number of times
  * Verify an external method is called with the correct parameters
* The rule of thumb for a mock is: if you are not going to add an assertion for
  some specific call, donâ€™t mock it. Use a stub instead.
