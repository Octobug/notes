A data-intensive application provides commonly needed functionalities:

- Store data (databases)
- Remember the result of an expensive operation to speed up reads (caches)
- Allow users to search data by keyword (search indexes)
- Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream
  processing)
- Periodically crunch a large amount of data (batch processing)

## Thinking About Data Systems

If an application-managed caching layer, or a full-text search server was
separated from the main database, it is normally the application code's
responsibility to keep those caches and indexes in sync with the main database.

    B -- Cache misses and writes --> D[Primary database]
    B -- Search requests --> E[Full-text index]
    B -- Asynchronous tasks --> F[Message queue]
    D -- Capture changes to data --> G[Appplication code]
    G -- Invalidate or update cache --> C
    G -- Apply updates\nto search index --> E
    F --> H[Application code]
    H -- e.g. send email --> I[Outside world]
```

Three important concerns in most software systems:

- Reliability: The system should continue to work correctly.
- Scalability: As the system grows, there should be reasonable ways of dealing
  with that growth.
- Maintainability: Different people should be able to work on the system,

## Reliability

A ***fault*** is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from
its spec, whereas a ***failure*** is when the system as a whole stops providing
the required service to the user.

- It is impossible to reduce the probability of a fault to zero;
- It is usually best to design fault-tolerance machanisms that prevant faults
  from causing failures.

### Hardware Faults

- Hard disks
- RAM
- Network cable
- Power blackout

### Software Errors

- OS kernel bugs
- Infrastructures service bugs
- Application bugs

### Human Errors

Configuration errors by operators were the leading cause of outages, whereas
hardware faults played a role in only 10-25% of outages.

Several aspects concerning human errors:

- Design systems in good ways
- Decouple places where people tend to make mistakes
- Test thoroughly at all levels
- Allow quick and easy recovery from human errors
- Set up detailed and clear monitoring
- Implement good management practices and training

### How Important Is Reliability

It's all about trade-offs.

## Scalability

***Scalability*** describes a system's ability to cope with increased load.

### Describing Load

Load can be described with a few numbers called ***load parameters***.
The best choice of parameters depends on the architecture.

e.g. Twitter's Timeline posts of a user. There are broadly two ways of
implementing it:

1. Do SQL JOIN query on `users` table and `tweets` table.
2. Insert new posts into the home timeline caches of a user's followers.

Approach 2 is better because the average rate of published tweets
(4.6k requests/s) is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the rate of home
timeline reads (300k requests/s).

The downside of approach 2 is that posting a tweet requires a lot of extra work.

This distribution of followers per user is a **key load parameter** for
discussing scalability.

> ðŸ’¡ Twitter at last combined both approaches together. For those tweets which
> are from users with a large number of followers, they were query through
> approach 1 then merged with results from approach 2.

### Describing Performance

- **throughput**
  - batch processing systems
- **response time**
  - online systems

It is usually better to use ***percentiles*** to illustrate response times
than to use mean response time. Because it tells you how many users actually
experienced that delay.

- `p50`: 50%
- `p99`: 99%
- `p999`: 99.9%

Percentiles are often used in ***service level objectives (SLOs)*** and
***service level agreements (SLAs)***, contracts that define the expected
performance and availability of a service.

### Approaches for Coping with Load

- scaling up: vertical scaling
- scaling out: horizontal scaling (shared-nothing)

## Maintainability

Three design principles for software systems:

- **Operability**: make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running
  smoothly.
- **Simplicity**: make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by
  removing as much complexity as possible from the system.
- **Evolvability**: make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system
  in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change.
  Also known as *extensibility*, *modifiability*, or *plasticity*.

### Operability: Making Life Easy for Operations

A good operations team typically is responsible for the following, and more:

- Monitoring quick restoring
- Tracking down problems
- Keeping things up to date
- Keeping tabs on how different systems affect each other
- Anticipating future problems and solving them early
- Establishing good practices and tools for deployment, configuration management
  , and more
- Performing complex maintenance tasks
- Secure the system
- Defining processes on dealing with operation problems
- Preserving the organization's knowledge

How to:

- Providing visibility (behavior and internals of the system)
- Providing good support for automation and integration
- Avoiding dependency on individual machine
- Providing good documentation
- Providing good default behavior
- Self-healing
- Exhibiting predictable behavior
