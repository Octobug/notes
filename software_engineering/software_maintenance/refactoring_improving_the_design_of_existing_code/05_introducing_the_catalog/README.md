## Format of the Refactorings

Each refactoring has five parts:

1. A **name**.
2. A short **sketch**.
3. The **motivation** describes why the refactoring should be done and describes
   circumstances in which it shouldn't be done.
4. The **mechanics** are a concise, step-by-step description of how to carry
   out the refactoring.
5. The **examples**.

ðŸ’¡ The key is to take small steps -- and the trickier the situation, the smaller
the steps.
