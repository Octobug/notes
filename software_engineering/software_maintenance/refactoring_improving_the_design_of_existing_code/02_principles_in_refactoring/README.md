## Defining Refactoring

- **Refactoring** (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to
  make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its
  observable behavior.
- **Refactoring** (verb): to restructure software by applying a series of
  refactorings without changing its observable behavior.

ðŸ’¡ If someone says their code was broken for a couple of days while they are
refactoring, you can be pretty sure they were not refactoring.

## The Two Hats

- **adding functionality**: should not be changing existing code, but just be
  adding new capabilities and tests.
- **refactoring**: should not be adding functionality but restructuring the
  code.
