## What is Refactoring?

Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in a way that does not
alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It
is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing
bugs. In essence, when you refactor, you are improving the design of the code
after it has been written.

Over time, the code will be modified, and the integrity of the system — its
structure according to that design — gradually fades. The code slowly sinks
from engineering to hacking.

Refactoring is the opposite of this practice. With refactoring, we can take a
bad, even chaotic, design and rework it into well-structured code. Each step is
simple—even simplistic.

## Who Should Read This Book?

- **If you want to understand what refactoring is**, read Chapter 1.
- **If you want to understand why you should refactor**, read the first two
  chapters.
- **If you want to find where you should refactor**, read Chapter 3.
- **If you want to actually do refactoring**, read the first four chapters
  completely, then skip-read the catalog.
