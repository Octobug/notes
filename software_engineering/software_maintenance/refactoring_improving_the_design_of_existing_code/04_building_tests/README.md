## The Value of Self-Testing Code

ðŸ’¡ Make sure all tests are fully automatic and that they check their own
results.

ðŸ’¡ A suite of tests is a powerful bug detector that decapitates the time it
takes to find bugs.

TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach to programming relies on short cycles
(test-code-refactor) of writing a (failing) test, writing the code to make that
test work, and refactoring to ensure the result is as clean as possible.
