## Introduction

The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps
that:

- Use **declarative** formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost
  for new developers joining the project;
- Have a **clean contract** with the underlying operating system, offering
  **maximum portability** between execution environments;
- Are suitable for **deployment** on modern **cloud platforms**, obviating the
  need for servers and systems administration;
- **Minimize divergence** between development and production, enabling
  **continuous deployment** for maximum agility;
- And can **scale up** without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or
  development practices.
