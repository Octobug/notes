## Understanding the Goal

You should be thinking of migrating to a microservice architecture in order to
achieve something that you can’t currently achieve with your existing system
architecture.

### A Common Failing

### Three Key Questions

- What are you hoping to achieve?
- Have you considered alternatives to using microservices?
- How will you know if the transition is working?

## Why Might You Choose Microservices?

### Improve Team Autonomy

Giving ownership to parts of the codebase to different teams could be one answer
(a modular monolith could still benefit you here): this could also be done by
identifying people empowered to make decisions for parts of the codebase on
functional grounds (e.g., Ryan knows display ads best, so he’s responsible for
that; Jane knows the most about tuning our query performance, so run anything in
that area past her first).

### Reduce Time to Market
