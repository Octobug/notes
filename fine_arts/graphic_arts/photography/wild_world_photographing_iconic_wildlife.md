💡 Photographic tip: Communicate!

- The necessary manoeuvring of the vehicle for tiger photography requires
  excellent communication between you and the guide and driver.
- To photograph tigers, it's not always good as close as possible.

### I saw a tiger!

- 📍 Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, India

### Eye contact with a tiger

- 📍 Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, India
- Arrowhead: a female tiger

💡 Photographic tip: Get low, get ahead

- For an animal like a tiger, getting at eye level, or below, is almost always
  the best for photography.
- Looking down doesn't often work well, as you want the photo to engage through
  eye contact with the subject.
