💡 Photographic tip: Get low, get ahead

  the best for photography.

  eye contact with the subject.

## Elephant

### Lying on the ground with elephants towering above me

- 📍 Kitirua Conservancy, Amboseli, Kenya
- 💡 Low-level camera angles are good for producing much more engaging shots of
  the elephants -- a technique that's particularly effective with calves.
- 📍 Mara North Conservancy, Greater Masai Mara, Kenya

💡 Photographic tip: Framing the calf

The calf often stays close to its mother, either to one side or or under its
mother's legs. Use these legs to frame to calf.
