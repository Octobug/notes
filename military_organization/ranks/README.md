## Modern

Modern military services recognize three broad categories of personnel. These
are codified in the [Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions),
which distinguish **officers**, **non-commissioned officers**, and
**enlisted men**.

Apart from conscripted personnel one can distinguish:

### Commissioned officers (军官)

### Warrant officers (准军官)

### Enlisted personnel (入伍人员)
