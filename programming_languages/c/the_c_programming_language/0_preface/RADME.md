# Preface

*The C Programming Language* was publicized in 1978.

In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a
committee whose goal was to produce "an unambiguous and machine-independent
definition of the language C". And its result is the ANSI standard for C.

C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized
to any particular area of application.

C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on
the DEC PDP-11, by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie)
