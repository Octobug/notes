Do this four times, counting “ONE–TWO–THREE–FOUR.”
Do the same with the 2nd fingers, then the 4th fingers, then the thumbs,
and finally with the 5th fingers.
Repeat several times, then shake out your hands vigorously.
Repeat again.

### Four Good Reasons for Playing with Curved Fingers

1. When the fingers are curved, each finger has, in effect, the same length.
2. Curved fingers bring the thumb into the correct playing position.
3. With curved fingers, keys respond instantly. You are IN CONTROL when you CURVE!
4. Moving over the keys will require turning the thumb ***under*** the fingers and crossing fingers ***over*** the thumb. Curved fingers provide an ARCH that makes this motion possible.
