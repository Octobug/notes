# Week 3

## Twelve Frets and Twelve Half Steps

The half steps correspond to all 12 frets of the fretboard.

### The Note Wheel

There are sharps and flats between every note except B & C and E & F.

These 12 steps in Western music divide the musical pallet in a way that allows
is to create melodies and chords that sound pleasing to us.

#### Clock Wise

There is a sharp(`#`) above every note except B and E.

#### Counter Clock Wise

There is a flat(`b`) below every note except F and C.

### Main Points

💡 We can conclude that there's some notes on guitar that is actually repeated
on other strings.

The sharp or the flat is often referred to as an accidental（临时符，变音记号）.

In addition, the word flat can also be used to define going lower in music, and
the word sharp can be used to define going higher in music.

- a half step is one fret
- a whole step is two frets

## Notes on the Fretboard

💡 The first E string is two octaves higher than the lower E string.

Knowing exactly where what we call the root of the chord is, allows you to be
able to move chords around. And typically many chords take the name of the
root, which is the lowest note.

So that's one of the reasons why we'll learn the fifth and sixth strings.
Because the roots for those chords that we're going to be learning, often
occurs on the lowest strings.
